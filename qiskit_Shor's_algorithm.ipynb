        "Integer factorization means breaking down a larger number into smaller numbers that, when multiplied together, give you the original number. For example, you can break down $100$ into $10 \\times 10$. If you only use prime numbers (numbers that can't be divided by anything other than 1 and themselves), it's called prime factorization. For instance, the prime factorization of $100$ is $2 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 5$.\n",

        "When the integers are very large, no efficient classical integer factorization algorithm is known. The hardest factorization problems are semiprime numbers, which are the product of two prime numbers. In 2009, a team of researchers factored a semiprime number with 232 decimal digits (768 bits). They spent computational time equivalent to over two thousand years on a single core 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron processor with 2 GB RAM:\n",

        "Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization that runs in polynomial time. Formulated in 1994, it dramatically changed our understanding of which computational problems are manageable. This motivated the study of new quantum algorithms and the development of quantum computers. It also sped up research into new cryptosystems not based on integer factorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shor's algorithm has been experimentally realized by multiple teams for specific composite integers. The integer $15$ was first factored into $3 \\times 5$ in 2001 using seven NMR qubits. Since then, it has been implemented using four photon qubits in 2007 by two teams, three solid state qubits in 2012, and five trapped ion qubits in 2016. The integer $21$ was factored into $3 \\times 7$ in 2012 using a photon qubit and qutrit (a three-level system). These experiments rely on significant optimizations of Shor's algorithm based on prior knowledge of the expected results. Generally, $2 + \\frac{3}{2} \\log_2 N$ qubits are needed to factor the composite integer $N$, meaning at least $1154$ qubits would be needed to factor $RSA-768$ above.\n",
